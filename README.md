# Project Description
In this project, we targeted an audience interested in philosophy. With this focus, we developed a historical webpage that showcases the most prominent philosophers throughout history.

The page features a central timeline displaying various philosophers arranged chronologically, with the height of each element representing the philosopher’s lifespan. Additionally, the timeline highlights the main branches of philosophy: Ethics, Metaphysics, Logic, Epistemology, Politics, and Aesthetics.

When a user hovers over a philosopher, lines appear connecting them to their respective areas of interest. By clicking on a philosopher, the timeline view splits in half, revealing a section with detailed information about the individual: an image, lifespan, philosophical school, fields of study, and a short descriptive text about their contributions.

# Page functionalities 

On this page, you will find the following features (all of which are explained in the tutorial page):

- Navigation through philosophical eras;
- Categories of interest assigned to each philosopher;
- Glossary of terms with quick explanations;
- Marking of historical events along the timeline;
- Granularity level;
- Search bar for terms.

# Task Distribution
- **Larissa:** Authored philosopher data, created glossary entries, and selected content for the Philosophy.
- **Luciano:** Performed web scraping for philosopher interest data and implemented backend functionalities.
- **Kaiky:** Contributed to the Home and Tutorial pages, and handled overall styling.

Overall, all members collaborated on the development of the timeline, with each feature involving contributions from all three participants.

# Estimated Workload
It is estimated that each team member dedicated approximately 100 hours to the project on average.
